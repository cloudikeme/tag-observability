description: >
  The most generic and common form of telemetry is a log entry. At a minimun, a log
  is composed of a timestamp and a string. When emitted from a system, logs are typically
  enriched with additional metadata such as the process, location and node producing the log.

attributes:
  - attribute: timestamp
    description: >
      A point in time associated with the log entry. Typically the end of an event
      when enough data is present to record useful results.

  - attribute: body
    description: >
      The primary content of the log entry. This is typically a string but may be
      a structured object encoded as JSON or another format.

    description: >
      Logs are the most common form of telemetry used for debugging. They are often
      used to record the state of a system at a particular point in time or to record
      the flow of control through a system. Log storage and querying systems enable 
      searching for logs that match a particular pattern within a time range.
