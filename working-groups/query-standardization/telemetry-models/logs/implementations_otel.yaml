      See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/
    specification:
      - map<String, Any>

  - attribute: Timestamp
    description: >
      Time when the event occurred measured by the origin clock, i.e. the time at the 
      source. This field is optional, it may be missing if the source timestamp is

      - uint64 nanoseconds since the Unix epoch

  - attribute: ObservedTimestamp
    description: >
      Time when the event was observed by the telemetry library or collection system.
    specification:
      - uint64 nanoseconds since the Unix epoch

  - attribute: TraceId
    description: >
      Unique identifier of a trace. A trace groups multiple spans into a single 
      unit of work. This field is optional.
    specification:
      - byte sequence

  - attribute: SpanId
    description: >
      Unique identifier of a span. A span represents a single operation within a trace.
      This field is optional.
    specification:
      - byte sequence

  - attribute: TraceFlags
    description: >
      Flags that apply to the trace such as SAMPLED. This field is optional.
    specification:
      - byte

  - attribute: SeverityText
    description: >
      The log level or severity of the log entry. This field is optional.
    specification:
      - string

  - attribute: SeverityNumber
    description: >
      The log level or severity of the log entry encoded as a numeric value. This 
      field is optional.
    specification:
      - number

  - attribute: Body
    description: >
      The primary content of the log entry. This is typically a string but may be
      a structured object encoded as JSON or another format. This field is optional.
    specification:
      - any

  - attribute: Resource
    description: >
      The entity that produced the log entry. Multiple occurrences of events coming 
      from the same event source can happen across time and they all have the same 
      value of Resource. This field is optional.
      See https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/
    specification:
      - OTel Resource

  - attribute: InstrumentationScope
    description: >
      The scope of the instrumentation that produced the log entry such as the library,
      module, package or class. This field is optional.
      See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/common/mapping-to-non-otlp.md#instrumentationscope
    specification:
      - OTel Instrumentation Scope
