description: >
  Distributed traces are a form of telemetry that records the flow of a request through
  a distributed system. A trace is composed of a series of spans, each representing a
  single operation within the system. Spans are linked together to form a directed trace
  graph or tree. The following attributes are common to trace spans.

attributes:
  - attribute: Trace ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier of a trace. A trace groups multiple spans into a single unit of
      work. This field is required.
    specification:
      - byte sequence

  - attribute: Span ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier of a span. A span represents a single operation within a trace.
      This field is required.
    specification:
      - byte sequence

  - attribute: Parent Span ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier of the parent span. This field is required except for the root
      span.
    specification:
      - byte sequence

  - attribute: Name
    description: >
      A descriptive name of the span. This field is required.
    specification:
      - string

  - attribute: Start Time
    description: >
      Time when the operation started measured by the origin clock, i.e. the time at the
      source. This field is required.
    specification:
      - Generally a uint64 with the Unix epoch in micro or nano seconds.
