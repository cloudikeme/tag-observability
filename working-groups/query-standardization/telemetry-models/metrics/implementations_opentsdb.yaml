notes: >
  OpenTSDB does not impose a type on simple numeric metrics, e.g. Gauge vs Counter 
  vs monotonic value. Instead it is up to the user to interpret the data at query time.

arch-types:
  - id: metric
    description: >
      A single measurement.
    attributes:
      - attribute: Name
        description: >
          The name of the metric.
        specification:
          - string
      - attribute: Value
        description: >
          The value of the metric.
        specification:
          - single or double precision floating point or integer
      - attribute: Tags
        description: >
          A collection of key-value pairs that describe the metric.
        specification:
          - map of string to string
      - attribute: Timestamp
        description: >
          The time when the metric was recorded.
        specification:
          - uint64 Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds

  - id: Histogram
    description: >
      A bucketed collection of counts for a metric.
    specification:
      - Extends the Metric type, replacing the value with the histogram buckets.
    attributes:
      - attribute: Underflow Count
        description: >
          The number of values that were less than the minimum bucket.
        specification:
          - integer
      - attribute: Overflow Count
        description: >
          The number of values that were greater than the maximum bucket.
        specification:
          - integer
      - attribute: Buckets
        description: >
          A collection of buckets that contain the counts of values.
        specification:
          - array of Bucket

additional:
  - type: Bucket
    description: >
      A single bucket in a histogram.
    attributes:
      - attribute: Upper Bound
        description: >
          The upper bound of the bucket.
        specification:
          - double
      - attribute: Lower Bound
        description: >
          The lower bound of the bucket.
        specification:
          - double
      - attribute: Count
        description: >
          The number of values that fall into the bucket.
        specification:
          - integer
