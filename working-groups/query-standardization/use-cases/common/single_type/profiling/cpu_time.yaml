title: CPU Time

description: >
  Most default profiles start by showing a percentage of CPU time spent executing
  a particular function in a call stack for the duration of the profile. This lets
  determine what functions may be candidates for optimization. Data can be aggregated
  across instances and time to determine trends.

inputs:
  - CPU profile

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Typically displayed in a flame graph or icicle graph where the percent of time
      spent in a function is represented by the width of the function's box. 

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Trend analysis can be applied to determine if a function is taking more CPU time
      over time or between releases.

contexts:
  streaming: true
  real_time: true
