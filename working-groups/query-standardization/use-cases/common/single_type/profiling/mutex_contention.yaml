title: Mutex Contention

description: >
  Mutex contention is a common problem in multithreaded applications where multiple threads
  are trying to acquire the same lock. This can lead to performance degradation as threads
  are blocked waiting for the lock to be released. Profiling mutex contention can help
  identify which locks are contended and which threads are waiting on them.
