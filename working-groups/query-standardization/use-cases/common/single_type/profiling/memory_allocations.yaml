title: Memory Allocations

description: >
  Memory allocations are a common source of performance problems in applications. Profiling
  memory allocations can help identify which functions are allocating the most memory and
  which functions are responsible for the most allocations. This can help identify memory
  leaks, inefficient memory usage, and other memory related performance problems.

inputs:
  - memory allocation profile

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Typically displayed in a flame graph or icicle graph where the number or size of
      allocations in a function is represented by the width of the function's box. 

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Trend analysis can be applied to determine if a function is allocating more memory
      over time or between releases.

contexts:
  streaming: true
  real_time: true
  batch: true
