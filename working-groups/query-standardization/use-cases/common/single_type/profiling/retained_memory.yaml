title: Retained Memory

description: >
  Retained memory is the amount of memory that is held by an object and its descendants
  that cannot be garbage collected or deleted. Profiling retained memory can help identify objects
  that are holding onto memory that is no longer needed, which can lead to memory leaks
  and other performance problems. Profiles are able to list the type and size of retained
  objects.
