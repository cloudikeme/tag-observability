title: Value Extraction

description: >
  While spans measure the latency of an operation, additional information can be stored
  in dimensions or annotations. Querying systems can then extract these data for further
  analysis such as counting distinct values or converting numerical values into metrics.

inputs:
  - trace spans

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Extracted values can be visualized in a table or chart. For example, a histogram
      of the number of spans with a particular status code can be displayed.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Alerts can be configured to trigger if a particular value exceeds a threshold 
      in a span, for example the number of records processed in a Spark task.
