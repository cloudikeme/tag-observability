title: Topology Graph

description: >
  Distributed traces are often used to build a topology of services involved in a 
  transaction. As traces are often sampled, the data can be combined with netflow 
  information for a more complete picture. 

inputs:
  - trace spans

uses:
- type: Visualization
  description: >
    Topology graphs are often displayed as a directed graph with nodes representing
    services and edges representing the communication between services. The size of
    the node can represent the number of spans or the latency of the service. The
    color of the node can represent the error rate or the service name.

- type: Actioning
  description: >
    Combining the topology with error rates and latencies, actions can walk the graph
    to find the most likely service causing issues for upstream services, reducing
    the number of alerts and improving MTTR.
