title: Critical Path Analysis

description: >
  From project planning, critical path analysis is the process of scheduling dependent tasks
  for efficient execution. Reversing the process and applying it to distributed traces 
  allows for determining which aspects of call path impacted overall latency the most.
  CPA is useful in that simply looking at the longest span in a trace (often the root) is
  not indicative of dependencies that span may be waiting on. Instead, the longest 
  critical path _segment_ is the most impactful to overall latency and a target for 
  optimization.

inputs:
  - distributed traces

Uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      A view may show a waterfall or Gantt style chart with only the spans participating in
      the critical path. Another can overlay critical path segments ontop of the of the full
      trace.

  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      A segment chart can show critical path segment time per service for a given trace or
      aggregated for a series of similar traces.
