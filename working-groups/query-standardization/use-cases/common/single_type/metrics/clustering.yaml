title: Clustering Analysis

description: >
  By grouping a metric or expression by various values and displaying lines on a chart
  over time, users can identify clusters of similar behavior based on dimensions such as
  the software version, node type or resource limits. Likewise, outliers are often 
  visible as trending outside one ore more clusters. 
  For programmatic analysis, clustering algorithms can be employed to determine the number
  of clusters and time series that belong to each cluster.

inputs:
  - metrics

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Typically plotted in line charts over time where bands of lines represent clusters.
      Heatmaps are also useful over time. For spatial aggregation, scatter plots can be 
      used.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      With the application of a clustering algorithm, alerts can be set up to trigger when
      the number of clusters change or when a time series moves from one cluster to another.
