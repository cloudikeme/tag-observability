title: Filter by Value

description: >
  Visualizations with many time series are often difficult to parse. By applying a filter 
  with a predicate evaluated against the measurement instead of time series meta data,
  data points or entire time series can be removed from charts.
  Filtering by value also enables simple threshold based alerting by taking action on
  any data points or series matching the predicate.

  - metrics
