title: Forecasting

description: >
  Metrics are often used for forecasting due the ability to efficiently store metrics
  over a long period of time. Incoming data is compared against the forecasted value
  and deviations greater than a configured threshold are used to trigger actions.
  Forecasts can be computed at query time, updated in real-time via streaming and
  stateful stores or computed periodically in batch jobs.

inputs:
  - metrics

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Charts are often used with the observed data alongside the forecasted values.
      If action thresholds are present, additional bounds can be drawn showing the upper
      and lower limits.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Using a threshold and comparing observed values against forecasted values at the
      proper timestamp, actions can be triggered to indicate potential errors.
