title: Period over Period Analysis

description: >
  Period over period analysis is a common operation in time series analysis where
  the value of a metric is compared to the same metric at one or more previous time 
  periods in the same chart or expression. This is useful for identifying trends, 
  seasonality, and anomalies in the data. 
  The query time range is often shifted by one week for diurnal seasonality. Accounting for
  day light savings time or holidays can be included.
  Aggregating previous periods can be feed into a forecast model to predict future values, accounting for seasonal behavior.

inputs:
  - metrics

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Line charts are commonly used to visualize the current period and previous periods
      side by side with different colors, transparencies or line styles denoting earlier
      periods.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Alerts can be triggered when the current period deviates from the expected level
      based on the previous periods. This can be used to detect anomalies or predict future
      values.
