title: Ratio Calculation

description: >
  Ratios are commonly used in metric expressions to determine a time series and others in
  a cohort or related series. For example, in a cluster of application nodes, a query can 
  compute what percentage of requests each node is handling and look for outliers. (Similar
  to the clustering use case). A common use is to express the percent of service requests
  with errors compared to the total requests. 

inputs:
  - metrics

      Ratios can be used to trigger alerts when a ratio exceeds a threshold. For example,
      if the ratio of errors to total requests exceeds 1%, an alert can be triggered.
