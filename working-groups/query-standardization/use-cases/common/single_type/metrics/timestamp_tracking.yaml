title: Timestamp Tracking

description: >
  Time sensitive contexts can be measured as metrics by publishing the time since an
  event, a countdown to a future event, or Unix epoch timestamp as the metric value.
  For example, an X.509 certificate used for TLS encryption has a start and end date.
  The expiration can be tracked as a metric and alerts can be triggered when the 
  certificate is close to expiration. Likewise, if an event hasn't occurred within a
  certain period of time, action can be taken to investigate.
