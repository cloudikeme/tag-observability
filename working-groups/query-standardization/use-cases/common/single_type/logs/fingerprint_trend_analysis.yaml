title: Fingerprint Trend Analysis

description: >
  Fingerprinting is a means of normalizing and identifying log entries in order to 
  extract various statistics regarding occurrences. For example, the log "Starting 
  application A" at level INFO would have the same fingerprint regardless of what 
  application version is deployed, how many nodes it is deployed on, etc. Given
  the fingerprint, various analysis can be performed over time such as looking at
  how often that line occurs over time or if the line has not been observed before.
  Fingerprints can be granular or generalized. E.g. an log with place holders like
  "Error processing request for user %s" can have a single fingerprint for all users.

inputs:
  - logs

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Fingerprint trends can be visualized in a time series chart showing the count of
      each fingerprint over time. Two time periods can be selected and compared to show
      deltas of fingerprint occurrences, helping users to spot new entries with a new
      deployment

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Alerts can be set up to trigger when a fingerprint count exceeds a threshold or
      when a new fingerprint is observed. This can be used to detect new errors or
      anomalies in the logs.
