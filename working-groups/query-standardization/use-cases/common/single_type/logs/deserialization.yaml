title: Deserialization

description: >
  Logs are often used to transmit structured data in formats easy to parse by machines
  while still being human readable. For example, stack traces are included in exception 
  logs and payloads may be encoded as JSON. This data can be deserialized at query time,
  giving the user the ability to work with aspects of the data in a more structured way
  than having to craft complex regular expressions for extracting data. E.g. a JSON
  payload could be queried using JSONPath.

inputs:
  - logs

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      It's common to extract methods from these payloads for visualization in charts. 
      Distinct strings are presented in tables or charts with counts and stack traces
      may be enriched with source code links.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      The output can often be used in actions similar to other extractions.
