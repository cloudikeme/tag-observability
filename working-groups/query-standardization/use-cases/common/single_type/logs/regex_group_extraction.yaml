title: Regular Expression Group Extraction

description: >
  Regular expressions are used to extract structured data from unstructured logs. The 
  extracted data can then be used to generate metrics for visualization, correlate with
  distributed traces or visualize distinct values in a table. For example, an access
  log can be parsed to extract the HTTP status code, request path, and response time. 
  Extracted values can also be used to enrich log metadata in an ETL pipeline.

inputs:
  - logs

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Depending on the type of data extract, metrics can be displayed in a chart or routed
      to another system. Distinct strings can be visualized in a table with counts or in a
      time chart displaying counts.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Actions can be triggered based on the extracted fields. For example, if the HTTP
      status code is 500, developers can be notified of the error along with a stack trace
      and context.
