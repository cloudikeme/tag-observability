title: Transaction Tracing

description: >
  Before distributed tracing libraries existed, transaction IDs would be logged in 
  each system involved in order to correlate behavior. Today, some systems may not
  be instrumented with tracing so a transaction ID can be added to a span tag of a
  service calling a non-instrumented service. The service's logs can then be queried
  for the transaction ID to generate spans to complete a tracing DAG.

inputs:
  - logs
  - trace spans

uses:
  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      All tracing visualizations apply.

  - type: Actioning
    description: >
      Similar tracing actions can be taken such as alerting if the service latency
      has increased or transactions are failing.
